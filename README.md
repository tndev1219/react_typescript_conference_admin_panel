# Conference Admin Panel

This is a [MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) of a conference admin panel. It's a React-based TypeScript web application which enables conference Committee Members to manage the `Call for Papers` process.  Once the `talk proposal` is submitted, Committee Members have to read its description and then either accept or decline it.

## Setup

Follow these steps to setup the app:

1. `npm install` – install dependencies
2. `npm test` – run all tests (should fail unless you fix the app)
3. `npm start` – serve the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) (it automatically opens the app in your default browser)

There is also the `npm run test:watch` command available that starts `react-scripts-ts`/`jest` test runner in the watch mode. It enables choosing tests that are related to modified files only.
